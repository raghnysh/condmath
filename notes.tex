\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:113nrd0o}

This document is a set of rough notes on condensed mathematics, a
subject that was developed in the references \textcite{bib:872u2noz},
\textcite{bib:iy49ytm3}, and \textcite{bib:7k2n4jtn}.  The document is
a work in progress.  The files of the current version of the document
are available at \url{https://github.com/raghnysh/condmath}.

\section{Set theory}
\label{sec:pafnta4o}

This section contains some preliminaries on set theory: ordinals,
transfinite induction, cardinals, etc.  The description of these
topics here is informal because nothing is gained for the purposes of
these notes by making the development more rigorous.
