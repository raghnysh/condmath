# Notes on condensed mathematics

This project consists of my rough notes on condensed mathematics, a
subject that was developed in the references Scholze
([2019b](#scholze_2019b)), Scholze ([2019a](#scholze_2019a)), and
Clausen and Scholze ([2022](#clausen-and-scholze_2022)).  The project
is a work in progress.
